                    Hello and welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find a selection of personal projects I have developed to strengthen my skills in web design and development. These initial works were published on the Netlify platform, which allows me to host and preview websites for free..
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I’m integrating Git and GitHub into my workflow to manage version control and upload changes remotely via git push. Below, I present the first three projects I created. To explore more, feel free to visit my GitHub profile.
                </p>

            <section class="espacio">
                <a class="p" href="https://emdeveloper.netlify.app/" target="_blank"><h3>EMDev</h3></a>
                <p>
                    This was my first real project using HTML and CSS. It represents an initial version of my personal web presence, where I share who I am, my interests, projects, and contact information. The site includes links to my social networks, a contact button, and the option to download the book I’m writing   </p>
                <p>
                    Although it’s a starting point, I’m proud of the result and plan to continue improving it as I deepen my knowledge.
                </p>

                <a class="p" href="https://gbvmakeup.netlify.app/" target="_blank"><h3>Make UP Store</h3></a>
                <p>
                    This project allowed me to further develop my CSS skills, particularly using CSS Grid to structure visual content. I designed a makeup store website with a vibrant and modern color palette, aiming for a more attractive aesthetic than conventional stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also served as the first mockup for a family project focused on selling beauty products.

                <a class="p" href="https://cafeyblogbogota.netlify.app/" target="_blank"><h3>BlogDeCafé</h3></a>
                <p>
                    In this project, I began applying more advanced HTML and CSS concepts while taking my first steps in JavaScript. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main focus was on creating a fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. I also used Git consistently for version control through regular commits. While I didn’t use branches since it was a solo project, it marked an important milestone in my learning journey.
